<h1>THE DEFUSER</h1>
<p>The defuser is a game of trust and strategy.</p>
<h2>RULES</h2>
<p>All players are in a room with a bomb. Multiple wires coming from the bomb, some are GOOD, some are BAD.</p>
<p>Once all the good wires are cut, the bomb is defused. Once all the bad wires are cut or 5 minutes elapses, the bomb explodes!</p>
<p>One player is a DEFUSER, the others are INFORMANTs. Only the defuser can cut wires. Only informants will get information about which wires are good or bad.</p>
<p>Each player (including the defuser) is either GOOD or EVIL.  Good players win if the bomb is defused. Evil players win if the bomb explodes.</p>
<p>Informants can vote to kill the defuser. When an evil defuser is killed, good players win. When a good defuser is killed, evil players win.</p>
